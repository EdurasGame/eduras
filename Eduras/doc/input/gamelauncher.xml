	    <para>
	        Users play the game with a game client. When client starts, it checkes for updates and then prompts user for login.
	        The User can use the client to configure their preferences and profile, start matches with friends and spectate or review other matches.

	    <title>Authentication</title>
	    <para>
	        Players need to authenticate to play the game. To login they need a unique username (account name) and a password.
	        An authentication can be successful only when game client version matches server version.
	    </para>
        <para>
	        To authenticate, players need to have an account. Account registration is done either in game client directly or on our website.
