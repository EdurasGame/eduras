		<title>(jme) Why locale?</title>
		<para>
			Localization is required to make texts in our game language-independent.
			We want to target a huge audience and with this feature, we can
			immediately reach thousands of people.
		</para>

	<section>
	    <title>(jme) How it works</title>
	    <para>
	        Basically, each text fragment is represented by a placeholder and requires a call
	        to <computeroutput>Localization.getString(String)</computeroutput>. This method
	        replaces the key string with a real string in current active language.
	    </para>

	    <title>(jme) Usage</title>
	    <para>
	        Using the locale is very simple as there are a lot of helping functions.
	        If you want to see some usage examples, take a look into
	        <computeroutput>Eduras</computeroutput>-class.
	    </para>
	    <section>
	        <title>Creating the locale string</title>
	        <para>
	            First, you have to create a locale variable and a translated value.
	            To do this, check the <computeroutput>.properties</computeroutput>-files
	            in <computeroutput>locale</computeroutput> package.
	            There is one file for each language.
	        </para>
	        <para>
	            These files consist of many <emphasis>Key=Value</emphasis> pairs.
	            You will quickly realize what you need to do:
	            Just add a line to at least the default language file (en).
	            You can make up any key value but please keep it significant.
	        </para>

	        <title>Using the locale string</title>
	        <para>
	            To use locale strings, you have two methods available:
	        </para>
	        <itemizedlist>
	            <listitem>
	                <para><emphasis>getString(String key)</emphasis></para>
	                <para>
	                    You will use this method when there are no variables
	                    that have to be put in your message, e.g. in "Really exit?".
	                </para>
	            </listitem>
	            <listitem>
	                <para><emphasis>getStringF(String key, Object... args)</emphasis></para>
	                <para>
	                    Use this if you are using variables, for example in "It is 5 o'clock."
	                    there is a variable representing the hour. Different languages can differ
	                    in position of hour.
	                </para>
	                <para>
	                    To avoid using two separated strings use a
	                    <ulink url="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html#syntax">formatted string</ulink>
	                    and use this method.
	                    For example the above mentioned sentence would be "It is %d o'clock." in english and "Son las %d." in spanish.
	                </para>
	            </listitem>
	        </itemizedlist>
	        <para>
	            Both methods work similar to the <computeroutput>print</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>printf</computeroutput> methods
	            in <computeroutput>System.out</computeroutput>.
