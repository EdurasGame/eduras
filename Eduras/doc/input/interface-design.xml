	    <title>Why is interface design so important?</title>
	    <para>
			The interface of a game is more important than you think! Providing control over the whole game and presenting information to the player,
			it is one of the most important parts considering game design. It requires hard work to find a compromise between much control and a good overview.
			Overloading an interface is as useless as making it small and hard to read.

	    <title>Functional requirements</title>
	    <para>
	         There are many requirements that an interface has to meet.
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>
	                <emphasis>Minimap:</emphasis> Important to keep track of game actions, a minimap is indispensable for a successful gameplay.
	            </para>
	        </listitem>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>
	                <emphasis>Player information:</emphasis> Keep track of your health, munition and abilities helps to survival. 
	            </para>
	        </listitem>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>
	                <emphasis>Interactive actionbar:</emphasis> An useful feature would be an interactive actionbar that is displayed context-dependent.
	                For example while controlling a neutral unit or fighting in your base you can display location-specific actions.  
	            </para>
	        </listitem>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>
	                <emphasis>Game configuration:</emphasis> The player must have the ability to change some client settings to match his behaviour (see Usability).
	                In a multiplayer game, <ulink url="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21402242.jpg">one cannot simply pause the game</ulink>, so settings changes must apply on-the-fly.
	            </para>
	        </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>

	<section>
	    <title>Graphical targets</title>
	    <para>
			The Interface should be clean but not too abstract. It's style should match the game's style.
			Graphics should not be too complicated to distract the user from game itself but epic artwork style is epic.
			Too small interface will keep off players with bad seeing capabilities.
			But it is very important that players can recognize important facts like health and map position very fast.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	        It is a lot easier for players to learn the game if its interface is similar to common games. Considering popularity and first-play-enthusiasm the interface
	        should not matter. 
	    </para>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <title>Usability</title>
	    <para>
	        The interface doesn't only consist of the visual part of user interaction, there are also hidden things like keybindings, mouse interaction and so on.
	        This leads to an important point of gamer-friendlyness: individuality. A game with static possibilities to use is a silly game. A user wants to change
	        the way of interaction to his personal favourites. Some important features must not miss:
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>
	                <emphasis>Custom keybindings:</emphasis> Since games became faster and faster, custom keybindings became more popular, for example in World of Warcraft.
	                Allowing players to individualize their keybindings does integrate physically disabled people, too.
	            </para>
	        </listitem>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>
	                <emphasis>Shut up, please:</emphasis> Sound is very important but also a very critical point of a game. At this point, we should distinguish between sound and music.
	                While music creates athmosphere and game feeling, sounds point out specific actions or notifications. A player should be able to set the balance between sound and music
	                to his own preference or even turn it off (there might come up situations where you don't want to wake up roommates...).
	            </para>
	        </listitem>
	        <listitem>
	            <para>
	                <emphasis>Visual aids:</emphasis> Players with visual impairment may want to have a colorblind-mode with more contrast (like League of Legends). The ability
	                of changing the UI size may help users with higher resolutions to detect something on their map.
	            </para>
	        </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>

	        <title>What about us?</title>
	        <para>
	            Developers are really lacking in benefits from interface-design, so it needs to provide features to improve development and bug-fixing.
	            Thus we need a bug-report tool that reports bugs automatically on the one hand, and let the user report bugs and problems ingame.
	            After being reported, bugs are autmatically put into our <ulink url="http://illonis.dyndns.org/pstatus/Eduras">bug-database</ulink>.
	        </para>
	    </section>

	    <title>Spectator mode</title>
	    <para>
	        Spectator mode is a two-sided sword: One the one hand it allows other players to join in and learn from other player's gameplay. They can view significant matches
	        and discuss about teamplay. On the other hand it provides a way to get information about your opponent. If there's communication between spectators and players, this
	        can lead to a big advantage in favour of a team.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	        A solution could be a similar behaviour to League of Legends where spectator view is delayed 3 minutes. In some exceptions, e.g. on tournaments, there could be an exception.
	    </para>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <title>Game recording</title>
	    <para>
	        A very exciting feature is game recording. It allows a team to review their recent games, discuss failures and review group behaviour.
	        Due to recording mechanics, a recorded game requires only a small amount of memory as the game is not recorded as video file. Because of this players need to use their
	        game client to replay matches.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	        Replays bring a lot help for beginner players, too. They can watch replays that show advanced players to learn from their playstyle and moving behaviour.
	    </para>
