				This document serves as a mingle-mangle of thoughts about
				the game we're developing including goals, brainstorming, protocols of
				progress, architectural designs and anything that should be kept in
				mind. Feel free to add anything that in your opinion should be
				mentioned here. After consultation with other developers involved in
				the project, change parts of the documentation to fit to new ideas, but
				please <emphasis>DO NOT SIMPLY ERASE DOCUMENTATION THAT IS OUT OF DATE!
				</emphasis> Instead you should mark obsolete documentation by scratching
				out the text.
