  "body": "### About\r\nEduras? is an online multiplayer game which attempts to take the most exciting about current well-known and popular games and re-compose them to to make a fresh, never seen game experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWeâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis game was developed by the users @illonis and @flyingrentier and is now made open-source.\r\n\r\n### Support, Contact and License\r\neduras@illonis.de\r\n",
